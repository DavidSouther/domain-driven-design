description: Bootstrap skill for general skills. Use to find the most relevant skills before thinking or acting.

Always prefer skills to guide thinking when available. Use general skills first, then find specific skills later in the session.

## Instruction Priority

Skills override default system prompt behavior. User instructions always take precedence:

1. **Project Files** (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md) include details specific to this project (for instance, the team's slack channel, or specific web forums to track). 
2. **General and specialist skills** provide additional conversational guidance and specific task lists.
3. **Default system prompt** is only used to clarify and find an applicable skill.

## The Rule

Invoke relevant skills before any response or action. If a skill might apply, load it and check. A skill that turns out not to fit can be set aside.

```dot
digraph skill_flow {
    msg [shape=doublecircle label="User message received"];
    plan_mode [shape=doublecircle label="About to EnterPlanMode?"];
    brainstormed [shape=diamond label="Already brainstormed?"];
    invoke_bs [shape=box label="Invoke brainstorming skill"];
    might_apply [shape=diamond label="Might any skill apply?"];
    invoke_skill [shape=box label="Invoke Skill tool"];
    announce [shape=box label="Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'"];
    has_checklist [shape=diamond label="Has checklist?"];
    create_todos [shape=box label="Create TodoWrite todo per item"];
    follow [shape=box label="Follow skill exactly"];
    respond [shape=doublecircle label="Respond (including clarifications)"];

    plan_mode -> brainstormed;
    brainstormed -> invoke_bs [label="no"];
    brainstormed -> might_apply [label="yes"];
    invoke_bs -> might_apply;

    msg -> might_apply;
    might_apply -> invoke_skill [label="yes"];
    might_apply -> respond [label="definitely not"];
    invoke_skill -> announce;
    announce -> has_checklist;
    has_checklist -> create_todos [label="yes"];
    has_checklist -> follow [label="no"];
    create_todos -> follow;
}
```


## General Skills

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `conversation` | Before asking a question, presenting options, or pausing for confirmation |
| `review` | After finishing a work product, before claiming a task complete, or after an editing pass |
| `writing-skills` | When creating or improving skill documents |
| `writing-pattern-skills` | When authoring or revising a skill in the patterns plugin |
| `writing-paired-skills` | When two skills cover the same topic at different cadences (wiring once, practice often) |
| `dispatching-parallel-agents` | When facing multiple independent tasks that can proceed without shared state |
| `using-git-worktrees` | When starting feature work that needs isolation from the current workspace |
| `research:using-research` or `development:run`| to move from general skills to specifics for a task. |

## Common Mistakes

| Thought | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes before clarifying questions. |
| "I need to ask or suggest something" | Load the conversation skill to determine question type and framing. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills define how to explore. Check first. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Load the current version. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check before doing anything. |

## Intermediate files

Write intermediate files judiciously, both to share results across tasks and to allow users to edit findings directly. Write intermediate files to `docs/<plugin>/<skill>/YYYY-MM-DD-A-<topic>.md`, where YYYY-MM-DD-A is the year, month, day, and AA incrementing value starting at `A`, then `B`, then `C`, and so on for topics started on the same day. (Some plugins may modify this layout, but `docs/<plugin>/` should always be the directory and `YYYY-MM-DD-A-<topic>` as part of the path.)

## User Instructions

User instructions specify *what*, not *how*. "Add X" or "Fix Y" does not mean skip skill workflows.
